Yes — BambooHR exposes approved time off via its API, and n8n can pull it with a simple HTTP Request node.

You have two good options:

Option A (most direct): “Get Time Off Requests” filtered to approved

BambooHR endpoint:
GET https://{companyDomain}.bamboohr.com/api/v1/time_off/requests

The API supports filtering by date range (start/end) and status (plus employee/type filters).
Also, Bamboo made start and end mandatory for this endpoint years ago.

n8n setup

Create BambooHR API credentials

Use BambooHR API auth (Bamboo’s API is under https://{companyDomain}.bamboohr.com/api/ and supports Basic auth).
(Bamboo also supports OAuth2 now, but Basic with an API key is usually fastest to wire up in n8n.)

n8n → HTTP Request node

Method: GET

URL: https://YOURCOMPANY.bamboohr.com/api/v1/time_off/requests

Auth: Basic Auth

Username: your BambooHR API key

Password: anything (often x)

Query params (example):

start=2026-01-01

end=2026-01-31

status=approved

Filter / normalize

Add a Code node to map the response into your preferred schema (employeeId, start, end, type, amount, etc.). The response commonly includes request status + dates.

Option B (simplest for “approved PTO calendar”): “Who’s Out”

If what you really want is: “show me who is out between dates” (and you’re fine excluding request metadata), use:

GET https://{companyDomain}.bamboohr.com/api/v1/time_off/whos_out

This endpoint returns employees out + holidays for a period.
In n8n you’d:

call it with the same start/end

filter out type === 'holiday' if you only want employee PTO (the payload often includes type: "timeOff" vs holiday).

Important gotchas

Permissions matter: the API key owner only sees employees/time-off types they have permission to view.

Status values: approved is valid; other statuses exist (requested/denied/canceled/etc.).

Don’t poll too aggressively: Bamboo can throttle frequent requests; handle 503s gracefully.

Quick “starter” n8n workflow outline

Cron (daily, or every hour)

HTTP Request → BambooHR time off endpoint (Option A or B)

Code → filter approved, shape fields

Upsert into your DB / notify Slack / block timesheet expectations

If you tell me which you prefer—Requests (more detail) or Who’s Out (calendar-friendly)—and what date window you want (next 14 days vs current pay period), I’ll give you the exact n8n node settings + a copy/paste Code node transform.
